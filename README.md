# Fujitsu Futro PoE Module Pinout

This repository documents the pinout of the 20-pin PoE connector found in Fujitsu Futro devices.

## 20-pin Connector Pin Layout

The PoE connector has a 2 mm pitch. I used a blue 20-pin USB 3.0 connector for my adapter.

Below is the pin layout for the PoE connector, which includes both power, PCIe, and unknown pins. This can be useful for modding or repurposing the connector for custom PCIe 1x expansion.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PowrGD# | Vcc 3.3V | Wake# | PoE 19V | PoE 19V | PoE 19V | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| GND     | TX-      | TX+   | GND     | RX-     | RX+     | GND     | CLK-    | CLK+    | GND     |

Fujitsu FUTRO S940 supports NVMe in the PoE connector.
